DESCRIPTION:
I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long and wide as the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 1 and 50.

Example
n = 3, so I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string:

MY SOLUTION

def generate_shape(n):
    y = '+'*n
    t = range(n)
    u = ''
    for i in t:
        u = u + y + '\n'
    return u[:-1]
