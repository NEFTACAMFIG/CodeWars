DESCRIPTION:
Write a function that calculates the least common multiple of its arguments; each argument is assumed to be a non-negative integer. 
In the case that there are no arguments (or the provided array in compiled languages is empty), return 1. If any argument is 0, return 0.


MY SOLUTION

import numpy as np
def lcm(*args):
    if args ==():
        return 1
    else:
        y = [i for i in args]
        arr = np.array(y)
        return np.lcm.reduce(arr)
